# When using claude as a coding copilot:

Coding Guidelines:
1. First discuss pseudocode/approach and wait for approval before generating actual code
2. Make minimal necessary modifications to existing code, strictly focused on the current task
3. Include comments only when logic is non-obvious or complex. Preserve existing comments if present. Carefully consider when adding new ones.
4. Create modular code with appropriate file separation without overengineering
5. Define TypeScript types/interfaces where applicable
6. Request real data rather than generating placeholder data when information is missing
7. Generate files fully, and use line modifications to exactly modify whats needed
